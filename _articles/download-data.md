Portals allow you to explore data stored in [Synapse](https://sagebionetworks.org/tools_resources/synapse-platform/), a technology platform that allows researchers to aggregate, organize, analyze and share scientific data, code and insights.

All entities in Synapse are automatically assigned a globally unique identifier used for reference with the format `syn12345678`. Often abbreviated to “synID”, the ID of an object never changes, even if the name does. 

Synapse is designed to integrate seamlessly with your analytical workflow. Therefore, options to download data are available in the [R client]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/download-data.md %}#r), [command line client]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/download-data.md %}#command-line) and [Python client]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/download-data.md %}#python).

## Find Files using Explore Data

Search the available files via Explore Data in the navigation bar. The Explore Data section presents several ways to select data files of interest. The top of the page displays pie charts that summarize the number of files based on file annotations of interest, including *Study, Data Type, Assay, Organism, Tissue*, among others. Selection of one of these chart segments will filter the table below to subset the set of files. Alternatively, access the filters using the facet selection boxes to the left of the Data table. For this example, you will [download the *processed* data and *metadata* from the *MC-CAA* study in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Knowledge Portal](https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Data?QueryWrapper0=%7B%22sql%22%3A%22SELECT%20*%20FROM%20syn11346063%22%2C%22limit%22%3A25%2C%22offset%22%3A0%2C%22selectedFacets%22%3A%5B%7B%22concreteType%22%3A%22org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnValuesRequest%22%2C%22columnName%22%3A%22study%22%2C%22facetValues%22%3A%5B%22MC-CAA%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22concreteType%22%3A%22org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnValuesRequest%22%2C%22columnName%22%3A%22dataSubtype%22%2C%22facetValues%22%3A%5B%22processed%22%2C%22metadata%22%5D%7D%5D%7D).

## Download Files

### Command Line

The Synapse command line client is *recommended* for downloading data from the portal as all data and file annotations can be downloaded with a single command.

The command line client is installed with the Synapse Python client, therefore [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required to [install the Synapse command line client](http://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/index.html#installation). [Login](https://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/CommandLineClient.html#login) to Synapse.

```
synapse login
```

From Explore Data in the portal, select the **Download Options** icon and **Programmatic Options** to visualize the command to download the data subset.

The command [`synapse get`](https://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/CommandLineClient.html#get) with the `-q` argument downloads files from the entirety of the portal data that meet the specified condition. In this example, all *processed* and *metadata* files from the *MC-CAA* study will be downloaded. Execute the following command from the directory where you would like to store the files.

```
synapse get -q "SELECT * FROM syn11346063 WHERE ( ( "study" = 'MC-CAA' ) AND ( "dataSubtype" = 'processed' OR "dataSubtype" = 'metadata' ) )" 
```

Also in your working directory, you will find a *SYNAPSE_TABLE_QUERY_###.csv* file that lists the annotations associated with each downloaded file. Here, you might find helpful experimental details relevant to how the data was processed. Additionally, you will find important details about the file itself including the file version number.

### R

In order to download data programmatically with R, you need a list of synIDs that correspond to the files. For downloading a large set of files, we recommend using the Synapse Python client. The Python client has been optimized for multi-threaded download and will provide you with faster download speeds.

Once you have identified the files you want to download from Explore Data, **Export Table** from Download Options.

<img style="width: 25%;" src="/assets/images/export-table-viz.png" alt="alt text">

You may choose to download the file as a *.csv* or *.tsv*. Files are named *Job-####*, where # includes a long set of numbers. Move this file to your working directory to proceed with the following steps. 

[Install the Synapse R client](https://r-docs.synapse.org/#installation) `synapser` to download data from Synapse. [Login](https://r-docs.synapse.org/articles/manageSynapseCredentials.html#manage-synapse-credentials) to Synapse.

```
library(synapser)
synLogin("my_username", "my_password")
```
Read the exported table into R, create a directory to store files and download data using `synGet`. If `downloadLocation` is not specified, the files are downloaded to a hidden directory called `/.synapseCache`. 
```
exported_table <- read.csv("Job-1342324092830598.csv")
dir.create("files")
lapply(exported_table$id, function(x) synGet(x,
                                             downloadLocation = "./files"))
```

The `exported_table` also includes experimental details relevant to how the data was processed.

[Install the Synapse Python client](http://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/index.html#installation) `synapseclient` to download data from Synapse, the `pandas` library to read a csv file and the `os` module to make a directory. [Login](http://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/index.html#connecting-to-synapse) to Synapse.
```
import synapseclient, pandas, os
syn = synapseclient.Synapse()

syn.login('my_username', 'my_password')
```
Read the exported table into Python, create a directory to store files and download data using `syn.get`. If `downloadLocation` is not specified, the files are downloaded to a hidden directory called `/.synapseCache`.

```
exported_table = pandas.read_csv("Job-1342324092830598.csv")
os.mkdir("files")
[syn.get(x, downloadLocation = "./files") for x in exported_table.id]
```

The `exported_table` also includes experimental details relevant to how the data was processed.
