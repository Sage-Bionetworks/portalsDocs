This tutorial will teach you the steps of participating in a challenge.

## Challenge Registration

If you do not have a Synapse account, please go to our [getting started guide](getting_started.md#becoming-a-certified-user) to become a certified Synapse user.
Participants **must** be registered for the challenge if they want to submit and participate. The registration button can be found on the home page or `How to Participate` page for every challenge. In order to be fully registered for any challenge, you must have a Synapse account. In addition, DREAM Challenges require that you:

(1) become a [certified user](getting_started.md#becoming-a-certified-user);

(2) agree to the DREAM Rules of participation, and

(3) agree to the Terms of Use to work with the Challenge data.

## Join or Create a Team

We encourage you to form a team with other participants for the challenge. You can either join a team or create your own team of collaborators. See instructions on how to form a team [here](teams.md). It is important to note that you **cannot** be on more than one team. Once you have submitted as a team or individual, you will not be able to submit as another team. If you decide to be part of a team, please register your team to the challenge - there will be a place to do this in every challenge wiki.

## Accessing Challenge Data

The data stored on the challenge Synapse site can be accessed using the Synapse website or programmatically using the Synapse R or Python clients. Instructions on using Synapse are provided in the [Synapse User Guide](./). File descriptions are provided on the Data Description page in each challenge wiki.

## Run your Algorithms and Submit to the Challenge

You can submit to a challenge queue by using the R, Python or web client. All submissions must be first uploaded to Synapse. Follow these [instructions](getting_started.md#project-and-data-management-on-synapse) to learn how to upload to a project. Most challenge queues will be labeled by `challengename-subchallenge#` as a challenge may have different questions that it may want you to answer.  Learn more about submitting to [evaluation queues](evaluation_queues.md)


## Share Ideas and Ask Questions

Every challenge has a discussion forum for participants (the `Discussion` tab on the Challenge Project page). The forum is a space for participants to ask any questions and raise ideas.

Instructions on how to use the discussion forum can be found [here](discussion.md)
